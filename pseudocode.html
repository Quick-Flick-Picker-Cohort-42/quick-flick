<!-- PSEUDO CODE 
4 components

Header that includes the following:
H1 displaying title. underneath, an input accepting user queries for movie titles. Returns an API call from TMDB API that provides a list of movies + information
a p holding an explanation of how to use the app. Could also include a button that reveals a p in every component explaining how to use it

Make List component - a section that includes:
button. on click, opens a modal div that provides users with the ability to create and name lists:
h2 - Create a list
input - for naming your list
button - for submitting your input. on click, function runs that creates a routed component (Use Movie List). Also, in Make List, the name of that list that was just created will be generated. clicking on this will mount the list component of the same name

Query Results component
this is the section that returns all of the movies from the user query in the header:
a ul containing multiple divs.movie:
img containing movie  poster and a p including description information
also, an add button. This button will open a modal asking which list the user wants to send their movie to. (NOTE: probably need to add a funciton to make a list in here as well for UX accessibility) On click, the movie is sent to the User List the user made.

User List Component
a series of lists that contain movies the user sent from the query section.
h2: the name of the list currently being shown
multiple div containers
